    <h1>How COVID-19 has pushed companies over the technology tipping point—and transformed business forever
    </h1>
    <P>n just a few months’ time, the COVID-19 crisis has brought about years of change in the way companies in all sectors and regions do business. According to a new McKinsey Global Survey of executives,1 their companies have accelerated the digitization of their customer and supply-chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years. And the share of digital or digitally enabled products in their portfolios has accelerated by a shocking seven years.2 Nearly all respondents say that their companies have stood up at least temporary solutions to meet many of the new demands on them, and much more quickly than they had thought possible before the crisis. What’s more, respondents expect most of these changes to be long lasting and are already making the kinds of investments that all but ensure they will stick. In fact, when we asked executives about the impact of the crisis on a range of measures, they say that funding for digital initiatives has increased more than anything else—more than increases in costs, the number of people in technology roles, and the number of customers.

        To stay competitive in this new business and economic environment requires new strategies and practices. Our findings suggest that executives are taking note: most respondents recognize technology’s strategic importance as a critical component of the business, not just a source of cost efficiencies. Respondents from the companies that have executed successful responses to the crisis report a range of technology capabilities that others don’t—most notably, filling gaps for technology talent during the crisis, the use of more advanced technologies, and speed in experimenting and innovating.3</P>
        <h2>Digital adoption has taken a quantum leap at both the organizational and industry levels</h2>
        <p>During the pandemic, consumers have moved dramatically toward online channels, and companies and industries have responded in turn. The survey results confirm the rapid shift toward interacting with customers through digital channels. They also show that rates of adoption are years ahead of where they were when previous surveys were conducted—and even more in developed Asia than in other regions (Exhibit 1). Respondents are three times likelier now than before the crisis to say that at least 80 percent of their customer interactions are digital in nature.</p>
        <h1>4 Reasons to Be Thankful for Technology During the COVID-19 Pandemic</h1>
        <p>Technology has been making travel easier for decades. For example, can you imagine airlines having to sell, cancel, and track flights manually? It seems like an impossible task. Without technology, airlines wouldn’t be able to offer near-instant seats on cancelled flights or offer self-booking through a website.

            Without technology, you wouldn’t get up-to-the-minute price change email notifications for hotel rooms and car rentals, either.
            
            Under normal circumstances, technology is a blessing to travelers. Here are several reasons to appreciate technology even more during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <h3>1. Software programs can sift through medical studies</h3>
            <p>There are currently more than 45,000 medical studies available as part of the White House’s COVID-19 data hub known as CORD-19. This data hub is considered “the most extensive collection of machine readable coronavirus literature to date.”

                There is an open invitation for AI researchers to sift through the data to gain unique insights about the incubation, treatment, symptoms, and prevention of the disease.
                
                The sheer volume of data available is too much for humans to sort through page-by-page. Using AI and machine learning algorithms to identify key pieces of data will bring faster understanding to the whole situation.</p>
                <h3>2. Technology makes traveling safer by limiting personal contact</h3>
                <P>Despite worldwide bans on non-essential travel, many people need to travel internationally to get home, tend to a family emergency, or access essential medical care. For those who have a legitimate reason to travel, technology creates a safer experience by limiting points of personal contact.

                    Electronic documentation reduces personal contact
                    
                    Traditionally, international travelers have been required to carry a physical passport that gets stamped at each destination. When all the pages are filled, the traveler must obtain a new passport.
                    
                    Although the technology isn’t new, some travelers qualify for electronic passports and electronic visas. An electronic passport is purely digital, while an electronic visa allows travelers to bypass sending a photo copy of their passport to obtain a visa.
                    
                    Just like electronic passports, there are electronic visa substitutes for certain countries. For example, say a British business traveler obtains an eTA to enter Canada. Applying for an eTA can be done entirely online without requiring any in-person appointments. The lack of in-person appointments eliminates a potential point of contact that could spread the virus.
                    
                    Likewise, when the business traveler enters Canada, their eTA will contain most of their information in an electronic record. They may be required to show their passport and/or other identifying documents, but interactions with customs and border officials will be brief.</P>
                    <h3>3. Airport and other travel technology is being pushed to the limit</h3>
                    <p>At first glance, this might sound like a bad thing. Why would anyone be thankful that travel technology is being pushed to the limit?

                        The benefit to having our electronic travel systems pushed to the limit is that if something is going to break, it will break much sooner when the system is under stress. If there are problems in the system, we’ll become aware of these issues quickly.
                        
                        Since we’re in a time when our travel systems can’t afford to be down for long, it’s almost guaranteed that issues will be swiftly dealt with whether it’s a software issue or a coordination problem. When issues arise outside of an urgent situation, they often go unresolved and cause even more problems.
                        
                        The need to manage travel safely and efficiently in a post-pandemic world will ensure that all issues will be handled promptly.</p>
                        <h2>5. Technology can predict infection</h2>
                        <p>Although the data is currently limited, researchers from Stanford Medicine want to use wearable tech devices to predict viral infection through data sent to the cloud.

                            In a new partnership with Fitbit and Scripps Research, researchers want to use smartwatch data to measure heartrate and skin temperature to identify when someone might be fighting off a virus. Their ultimate goal is to curb the spread of viral infections like COVID-19.
                            
                            In 2017, an algorithm was created to detect infection using data from a change in heart rate from a smartwatch. One study in particular showed that heart rate variation patterns can indicate illness even when the individual is asymptomatic.
                            
                            The Stanford researchers are currently looking for study participants. Researchers acknowledge that an elevated heart rate isn’t always a sign of infection, but want to investigate to see if they can sort out the different causes.</p>
                            <h1>The sky is the limit</h1>
                            <p>With technology, the sky really is the limit. Every new technological advance has the potential to improve the way we respond to and fight this coronavirus outbreak.</p>
